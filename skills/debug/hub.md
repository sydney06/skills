# /debug: hub mode

Read this only in hub mode (the trigger line in `SKILL.md`). The contract applies first; the section after it says exactly how this skill's own steps change. Anything not mentioned works as `SKILL.md` says.

<!-- HUB-CONTRACT:START (identical in every skill's hub.md; edit all or none) -->
## Hub contract

A hub is a folder holding several independent git repos plus a `workflow.repos.json` that lists them. The hub folder is its own small git repo: it versions only the workflow files (`docs/`, the hub `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, `workflow.repos.json`, `.gitignore`) and ignores every repo folder. Call the hub folder `HUB`.

1. **Detect.** `workflow.repos.json` at the project root: hub mode, the project root is `HUB`. Found only in the parent folder: the engineer opened one repo directly. Say so once, recommend reopening at the hub, and if they continue, treat the parent as `HUB` and this repo as the only target.
2. **Read the map.** Load `HUB/workflow.repos.json`. Each entry in `repos` has `name`, `path` (relative to `HUB`), `role`, `base` (its default branch), and `deploy`; `order` lists repo names with providers first. Read `HUB/AGENTS.md` (the platform map) and, for each target repo, `<path>/AGENTS.md` (its stack, commands, and `## Git`), plus nested ones as usual.
3. **Workspace = repo.** Apply every monorepo rule of this skill with workspaces = the listed repos, keyed by `name`: `docs/scope/<name>/`, `docs/specs/<name>/`, work that spans repos in `_root`, and the `docs/scope/index.md` rollup. Every `docs/` path is under `HUB`, never inside a repo. Code paths are `<path>/…`.
4. **Resolve the target repos** from the feature's scope folder, its code pointer, a repo name or path in the request, else ask (one panel, the likeliest recommended). A `_root` feature targets every repo its tasks name.
5. **Git runs in the repo.** Every `git` command this skill would run becomes `git -C <path> …` for the target repo, using that repo's `base` wherever the skill says `main`, `master`, or `BASE`. Every `gh` command runs with the repo as its working directory. Plain `git` in `HUB` is only for the hub's own workflow files. Never read a code change set from `HUB`: it holds no code, so an empty hub diff proves nothing.
6. **Change sets are per repo.** Wherever this skill gathers changed files, gather them in every target repo (every listed repo when none is named), prefix each path with its repo `path`, and report per repo. A listed repo that is missing or not a git checkout: say so and skip it.
7. **Deploy safety.** Merging to a repo's `base` deploys it (its `deploy` field). Never build on or commit to a repo's `base` branch; with git integration on, branch first. Name the `deploy` target before any push or PR. A change that spans repos ships in `order`, and every change to a provider stays backward compatible with the consumers already deployed, including mobile app builds already installed on phones.
8. **Commits stay in their repo.** Code, a repo's own `AGENTS.md`, its `CHANGELOG.md`, and its test files commit to that repo; `docs/` and the hub `AGENTS.md` commit to the hub. Offer each commit separately and never mix repos in one commit.
9. **Git settings.** Read `## Git` from the target repo's `AGENTS.md`, else from the hub's.

## How /debug changes in hub mode

- **Step 0:** name the repo the symptom shows up in, and the repo it may come from (a client error can originate in the API). Resolve both from `workflow.repos.json`.
- **Step 1:** reproduce with each repo's own commands, run from `<path>`; when the bug crosses repos, run the provider locally and point the client at it. Never reproduce against a deployed production environment.
- **Step 2:** history bisects run in the repo that changed: `git -C <path> bisect …`, `git -C <path> log -p -- <file>`. When the cause may be a provider change, compare the provider's recent commits with the consumer's expectations (the shared spec in `HUB/docs/specs/_root/`).
- **Step 5:** the fix lives in the repo that holds the cause. A provider fix stays backward compatible with deployed consumers, including installed mobile builds. If the real cause is the contract itself, lead with that and point to `/architect` on the `_root` spec.
- **Step 6:** the regression test goes in the repo that was fixed. Check siblings in every repo with a similar `role` (two mobile apps often share the same bug).
- **Report:** name the repo fixed and its `deploy` target.
